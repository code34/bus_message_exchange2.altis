	How to declare remote functions
	===========================
	You have to declare your remote functions as handlers. There is tow kinds of handlers
	- server handlers 
	- client handlers 

	The handler declaration must respect this syntax, and use those prefix:

	BME_netcode_server_remotefunction = { code to execute on server side };
	BME_netcode_remotefunction = { code to execute on client side };

	You can declare thoses handlers directly on your code, but it's more simple to use the default location:
	client side:
	- declare by default in BME_clienthandler.sqf

	server side:
	- declare by default in BME_serverhandler.sqf
