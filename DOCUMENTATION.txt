How call remote functions
======================

["remotefunction", _parameter, "client"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;
	
Call a remote function to a specific client
["remotefunction", _parameter, "client", clientid] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;

Call a remote function on the server
["remotefunction", _parameter, "server"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;
	
Call a remote function everywhere
["remotefunction", _parameter, "all"] call BME_fnc_publicvariable;

How to declare remote functions
===========================
You have to declare your remote functions as handlers. There is tow kinds of handlers
- server handlers 
- client handlers 

The handler declaration must respect this syntax, and use those prefix:

BME_netcode_server_remotefunction = { code to execute on server side };
BME_netcode_remotefunction = { code to execute on client side };

You can declare thoses handlers directly on your code, but it's more simple to use the default location:
client side:
- declare by default in BME_clienthandler.sqf

server side:
- declare by default in BME_serverhandler.sqf
